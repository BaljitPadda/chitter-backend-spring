# Chitter Backend recreated using Java and Spring
___

The Chitter Challenge involved creating a full-stack web application that functions like Twitter/X.


Requirements included:
* You should be able to see a list of tweets/peeps on the home page.
* You should be able to register as a new user.
* You should be able to log in and post a tweet/peep.

Here is a link to my original Chitter Challenge project which used the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node JS).

In this Chitter Backend Spring repo, I recreate the Chitter challenge backend using Java and Spring, and I have written some integration tests.

Technologies used in this project:

* Java
* Spring Web & REST
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data MongoDB
* Spring validation
* Maven

Enjoy!
